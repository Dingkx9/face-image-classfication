# Implementation of Decision Tree (DT) and Naive Bayes (NB) Algorithms to classify Multi-class Images 

DataSet used: Yale B and MNIST dataset

Implemented the DT and NB algorithms using numpy as the only dependency and performed 5-fold cross-validation to choose the best hyper parameteres. The two algorithms were then tested on both the datasets.

Bagging was also performed and we observed that the model's performance improved with bagging in comparison to a classical DT.
We also implemented pre-pruning on the decision tree algorithm.
